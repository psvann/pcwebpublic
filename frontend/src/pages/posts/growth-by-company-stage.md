> "In early stage companies, growth is marketing. At later stages, Growth is Operations." â€” Josh Thorens, VP of Growth, Torq 

Growth as a discipline is growing in popularity every minute. With every new [Reforge](https://reforge.com) cohort, this hybrid function is a popular hire at many startups looking to light their worlds on fire and impress investors. 

Growth is also a popular area for product managers, myself included, to push  their UX, data, and experimentation skills to new limits and finally [bury the hatchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burying_the_hatchet) with their colleagues in marketing and sales. 

But hiring for growth in a new or scaling startup isn't a straight-forward endeavor. Indeed, there are challenges in both hiring the role too early as well as hiring it too late. 

As a product leader turned first-growth-hire at an early stage startup, I've had a chance to see and experience various approaches to hiring for growth, and have put together the following guidance for future founders, CEOs, and Chief People people to better understand what "capital G" Growth is and how to bring growth into your organization. 

## What is Growth? 
Growth as a discipline traces its roots the early days of hyper-scaling Internet businesses like Facebook, HubSpot, and Uber. Early growth leads like (Deb Liu)[https://debliu.substack.com/p/growth-as-a-mindset], (Brian Balfour)[https://brianbalfour.com/], and (Andrew Chen)[https://andrewchen.com/] sought to change the way product and marketing interacted, creating a hybrid function that went beyond traditional product frameworks or the classic AARRR marketing funnel to understand and engage users. 

There's been plenty written about Growth, and if you are interested in learning more, there's no better place to start than (Reforge's Growth Series)[https://www.reforge.com/growth-series] introductory class. For this post, I'll just give a quick summary highlight of three core tenants of Growth, and why they matter to early stage companies. 

### Growth Core Tentants
![Two charts: one hockey stick expected growth; one stoachist relaistic growht](/images/posts/growth-by-company-stage.png)
#### 1. Retention > Acquisition 
The word "Growth" conjures up-and-to-the-right "hockey stick" ðŸ“ˆ charts. "New users are through the roof!" is a phrase every founder wants to hear. But true growth comes from retention and repeat use, not from signups. Retained users are akin to compound interest in finance â€” a long term strategy that leads to sustainability. The early days of getting to product-market fit (PMF) are anything but easy, but focus on quality, not quantity when it comes to users and customers. You'd rather have 10 users who can't live without your product than 1000 who use it once and never come back. 

#### 2. Loops Not Funnels
This is a favorite of every Reforge cohort. Like [McKinsey's famous Customer Decision Journey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-consumer-decision-journey), Growth loops acknowledge that customers aren't robotic autonomtons steadily progressing from awareness to purchase to repeat use in a linear function. (Ask my wife about my recent twelve-week-long camera purchase â€” complete with linked-list decision-tree frameworks, a Monte Carlo simulation, and review scraper â€” for evidence of this.) Thinking about how user engagement leads to additional user acquisition, and how these loops connect and compound over time in a succinct model, is the job of every growth practioner. Having a clear and differentiated strategy behind your model decisions is critical in early stages -- even if it's likely to change as you learn more about your market and product. 

#### 3. Data-Driven Decisions and Experimentation
At the heart of Growth is a data-driven mindset. "You can't manage what you can't measure" afterall. But while its too easy to give a hand-wavey "let's A/B test it" in lieu of actual decision making, it is true that to be successful, you need a strong framework for evaluating different growth strategies (let's not call them "hacks" any more, please) and doing so from one initiative to another. 

So how do we take these core tenants into an early stage organization, when PMF isn't certain and there are a million competing ideas with precious few resources to implement them? Let's explore. 

## Early Stage Growth Responsibilities
In the early days of a startup â€”- often characterized by being seed to pre-seed funded -- you have an idea more than you have a company. The primary goal is **__learning__**, via experimentation, rather than growth or scaling. 

You want to treat everything, from your initial prototypes to your rudimentary market positioning to your swag growth models, as hypotheses. Hypotheses that need to be tested. While most advise "PMF, then data, then growth", a growth leader in an early stage company can be highly effective in helping the team find product-market fit, and have the company ready to shoot out of a cannon when they do. 

Some areas of focus for growth leaders in early stage companies include: 

#### Growth Strategy and Model Iteration
I'm someone who thinks that most people want to "do strategy" but relatively few people know what that means or how to do so effectively. And I'm not entirely sure I know myself, to be honest, and I've never gotten a truly satisfacory answer on what that means, even when asking people with capital-S "Strategy" in their job titles. 

But nevertheless, it does help an organization to pick a destination to aim for and be able to describe which road you hope to take to get there. In the "PMF, then Data, then Growth" framework, you'd have a much more clearly defined view of the world before starting your first Growth Model, but at early stage companies, you don't have that luxury. 

That doesn't mean there's no value to creating a growth model early on in your company's history, so long as you willing to change it. Constantly. In the early days, you will have some foundational beliefs about your new venture based on your founders' beliefs, your mission, and your "disruption story". These can all be formulated into a hypothesis about how you can grow the business. 

![early growth model loop](/images/posts/early-growth-model-loop.png)
Early growth model loop from a seed stage company. 

For instance, in the early days of Slim.AI, we believed -- and still do -- that the responsibility for building and securing cloud-native apps was shifting left and becoming the responsibility of developers. Stemming from that, we asked ourselves how we could win the hearts and minds of developers and bring them along with us in this belief. We knew that developers were seeking to solve problems and that they tended to trust other developers for answers. With that, our inital growth model focused heavily on "content & community" -- we enlisted our engineers to provide content for our website, began a Twitch stream to learn and teach, and sought out adjacent communities with similar values. 

Other elements of the growth model, such as event-based marketing, influencer outreach, and viral content, would come later, and we needed to be open to making changes to our thinking. But that initial model largely holds to today, and we believe that those who engage in our community are some of our best users. 

#### V1 Retention Metrics
Chances are you won't know what to measure when you are in the early days of a company and pre-PMF. In fact, Job One for the organization at this stage is to have a reasonable hypothesis for what PMF would look like, and that is often in the form of repeat use among a core group of users. 

As a growth practioner in an early stage company, you want to carry the banner for retention metrics. You may not have the suite of product features to support repeat use, or the market infrastructure to educate users in why they should come back, but don't be seduced by the false promises of scaling acquisition early on. You will need to do _some_ acquisition work regardless -- you can't start a fire without any fuel -- but be sure to talk to as many early adopters as possible. 

This is the time to roll up your sleeves and do the work. I seen so many KPI and OKR discussions that are aiming to reach a near-perfect metric, some golden ratio that is time-boxed, S.M.A.R.T., gives a perfect representation of the Job to Be Done, and is a conference keynote speech in the making. More often than not, those metrics turn out to be off-the-mark, too hard to implement, and never make it to next cycle. And simply talking to users about the pain point they are trying to solve, how often the encounter it, and how close your product or concept is to solving it would have given you a "good enough" measure that would reflect progress against a goal well enough to reach the next milestone. 

This isn't to say there isn't a need for debate in the process of developing your first retention metrics. We debate these endlessly, and those conversations help create alignment on our foundational product vision, as well as giving us a framework for discussing what's coming next. 


#### Experimentation Infrastructure
With realtively few users, doing A/B tests the way they are run at large scale companies (with tens of thousands of users per cohort and 95-percent confidence intervals) is not realistic. That doesn't mean you simply throw your hands up and simply guess at what's working and what's not. By having some early (if simplistic) data generation and tracking in place, you can begin to build out what will become your experimentation infrastructure over time. 

For instance, maybe you have a couple of hundred people on an email list generated from the sign-up box on your pre-product homepage. That's enough to do a simple subject-line test for a monthly newsletter update. While the test may be inconclusive (and it is important to have good hygiene around consuming data and drawing conclusions), you're building a muscle in the organization for designing tests, executing them, and reviewing the results. Email, social media, paid ads, and community touch points are all great places to start experimenting with messaging and product ideas, and the data you generate will lead to healthy, constructive conversations in the organization. 

While you are executing your first experiments, it will also give you a chance to map out a marketing and growth tech stack. No doubt, you will require things like CRM, data and measurement tools, and user research. Develop a roadmap for these tools and technologies and map their capabilities to your experimentation needs at different stages of the business. For instance, at Slim.AI, we started with an inexpensive CRM system for early experiments and then moved to HubSpot when we hit a critical mass of users and needed more automation and wanted to run more testing. HubSpot and paid ads were sufficient for experimentation until we brought our product into a full beta, and we began to implement more product-focused tools like FullStory.

As you can see, many of the early stage responsibilities of a growth leader fall into a bucket that traditionally resembles marketing. You are helping define the customer and market, testing your assumptions on those early hypotheses, and building out a communications and data infrastructure that will power acquisition and retention later in the product lifecycle. Mainly, the focus is on learning from users and making good conclusions about the direction of your product to find PMF. 


## Scaling Growth Responsibilities 
As your company begins to gain traction with users and you see signs of product-market fit, you need to evolve your role as a Growth Leader within the organization. 

First, you'll be hiring. A lot. Especially if you are successful at raising subsequent rounds at quality valuations. 

Second, the needs of the organization change considerably from one stage to the next. The classic line: "What got you here won't get you there" applies in spades. 

This leads a lot of people to the question: `How will I know when to switch models?` and the answer is: `You won't.` It will be, and should be, a evolutionary and iterative process to develop your role -- and the role of Growth in your organization -- over time. 

Here are some goals that can help you focus and as you begin to think bigger about your startup and your role as a growth leader within it. 

## Enhance your data
While much changes as your business begins to scale -- for instance, you add sales, marketing, and customer success functions to the business -- some things don't. Namely, the focus on Retention as a key metric to track over time. 

However, now you'll want to be splitting retention by various slices of data -- say, acquisition channel, feature engagement, or other user demographics -- to get a better picture of what's moving the needle on rentetion. As a growth leader, you'll need to build coaltions with data analysts, engineers, and PMs to add better tracking, build new dashboards, and likely onboard new tech tools to get a clear picture. 

You'll also be adding more concrete metrics around customer acquisition, and working with new marketing hires to build, track, and improve things like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), return on ad spend (ROAS), and cost per lead (CPL). All this means that you, as a growth leader, will be looking at more monetization and acquisition data than in previous stages, and you'll want to be a driving force to improve the organizational capabilities in these areas. (Don't worry, you'll have _plenty_ of interest and help from sales, marketing, finance, and product.)

## Be the Connective Tissue 
When your venture begins to scale is when your role in Growth begins to take on aspects of how leading practioners often talk about growth -- the "go anywhere, do anything" hybrid function that creates bridges between different functional areas. In the early days of startups, teams are small and "cross-functional" isn't really a thing: Every one is just doing what needs to be done. 

But as you hire more people into the organization, the potential for silos and land-grabs, those all-too-common realities of modern organizational politics, become more likely. New hires mean new leaders; new leaders mean new ideas; new ideas mean conflicting ideas. 

You have two primary goals at this stage: 

1) Fight silos
2) Build, prove, hire, move. 


### Fighting silos 
You simply don't want to turtles in your scaling organization. Turtles are leaders or functional areas that keep their cards close to the vest, don't share what they are working on or their progress, and implement new systems simply based on preference rather than organizatoinal need. 

In my experience, there are two ways to fight silos: Communication and Collaboration. Leaders need to find communication pathways that create clarity among themselves, and also team members. This can be in the form of leadership team meetings and offsites, periodic written updates from each functional area, and biweekly 1:1s between functional leads. Collaboration is often just a matter of putting people in the right place to work together â€” yet is an increasingly large challenge in remote organizations.  

To an extent, silos are inevitable as organizations grow. Call it our innate tribalism or a simple law of complexity, they happen. But as a growth leader, your job is to fight them, and like weeds in a garden, starting early pays long term benefits. 

To fight silos, focus on communication. 

Re-examine the communication pathways that have evolved as the company formed and see if they are sufficient for the current needs of the organization. 

I focus on these areas: 

#### Updates
 How are daily or weekly status updates happening, if at all? While early stage companies will rail against "process" and "busy work", often a lack of formal communication impedes progress and rework stems from the chaos of non-communication. Similarly, Team Meetings feel like checking the box, but don't work to inform everyone, especially in meeting-heavy remote cultures or quickly scaling companies. 

My solution here is a simple bulleted-pointed doc (Google Doc, Notion, etc) that the entire team updates and we send to the rest of the company. It has a summary "highlights" section for executives and more detail -- say, A/B test results, links to designs, or recent decisions -- for individual project teams. 

Keep meetings focused on strategic or learning discussions, not status updates. 

#### Meetings 
For remote companies, as most startups are these days, meeting culture is a make-or-break consideration for the leadership team. Do you have enough meetings that information is effectively disseminating throughout the organization? But not so many that people are fighting meeting fatigue and spending 80-percent of their day on Zoom? Do some research here by interviewing teams internally, and work with your People people to review any major standing meetings. 

YMMV, but the best working model I've found is: 
- One team meeting per functional area. Only team members attend. Focus is tactics for the week ahead. Weekly on Mondays.  
- One cross-functional presentation meeting per functional area per week or biweekly. Open meeting, including team members and representatives from others. Focus is on large strategic projects (plans for, review of, results from). To prevent meeteing fatigue on your team, split up assignments for these among team members and have them summarize relevant notes back to your team chat channel. 
- One company-wide All Hands biweekly or monthly. Full attendance. 
- Weekly 1:1s between managers and ICs. 
- Biweekly 1:1s between leaders of different functional areas. 

#### Big News
What happens during major feature launches or when similarly big news strikes that requires a lot of coordination? This is the stress test of your organizational communication capabilities. 

Meetings are a constant balance point for scaling organizations. Keep them light and make sure they earn their place on the calendar. 

# Build, Prove, Hire, Move 
In her seminal piece on startup leadership, ["Give Away Your Legos"](https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups), Molly Graham writes:

> If you personally want to grow as fast as your company, you have to give away your job every couple months.

I'd add that as a Growth Leader, you first you need to build out the function that best fits your growth model. 

For instance, if you are mainly focused on Company Generated Content as your primary Growth Loop, you need to build a content engine comprised of an editorial process, network of writers, and the technology to publish content for SEO and social. 

Your first instinct will be: Let's hire a growth PM or marketing manager. And marketing ops. And a content manager. And a social media manager. But then you will be both learning what resonates with your audience while at the same time trying teach the job to a new hire. 

Writing the initial posts yourself (and finding a trusted copy editor) will teach you loads about the voice, content, and product strategy â€” not to mention help you hone the story you are telling. Getting into the details of the systems you are using will help you onboard, guide, and plan future enhancements as new hires come in. 

Most importantly, DIY'ing these early stages show teach you about the analytics and metrics you will want to gauge as a manager. You will need to justify the investment of scarce resources into new head count. I call this the 'Prove' phase. 

Once you've proven the business value, it's time for you as a growth lead to shift your focus to a new and urgent need. Perhaps you've built a communications infrastructure for acquisition and onboarding, but now need to build product features to improve retention. First, you must be sure to capture, maintain, and accelerate the momentum you've built â€” and usually this comes in the form of a new hire. I'll write more on team building, hiring growth folks, and functional buildouts in future posts. For now, just keep the "giving away your Legos" ethos at hand, hire a capable steward of the work you've built, and go solve the next unsolvable problem.

## Conclusion 
Since Growth is a relatively new practice that is gaining momentum in organizations of all sizes, it will still take time, thought, and experimentation for startups to effectively leverage it in the best way possible. 

While traditional thinking around Growth is to hire a growth leader later, once core functions like product, engineering, marketing, and early sales motions are established, I've personally seen and experienced the value of bringing Growth in early and being a key partner in building out the other areas of a rocket-ship business. But it takes the right people, the right approach, and there's no one-sized fits all method. 

Best of luck in building your own Growth and keep me posted on how it is going.
